Hi!



This is a text file to explain how these programs work.



So, first things first, you'll need to install a few things:


1: Python 2

2: the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) for Python: https://www.nltk.org/

	2b: you'll need to install cmudict as well. To do this:
		Open the console
		Type python
		Type import nltk
		Type nltk.download('cmudict')
	Done!
3: markovify: https://github.com/jsvine/markovify
    (note: this is only for the sonnetMakerMarkov.py file)

4: tweepy: http://www.tweepy.org/



Now, you have a choice. You can either run a program that will construct a sonnet from tweets, or you can construct a sonnet from semi-randomly generated text.

To generate a sonnet from tweets, you need to edit the code in sonnetMakerTweets.py. You need to give the strings consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, and access_secret your own information.
For a tutorial on how to do this: https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/03/02/mining-twitter-data-with-python-part-1/



To generate a sonnet using some other text as an example, simply fill corpus.txt with whatever text you'd like. I have provided the text of the Iliad and some of Shakespeare's work as an example.



Now, to generate your sonnet, type "python sonnetMakerMarkov.py" or "python sonnetMakerTweets.py" into the console.

The generation will take a while, because you are processing human language.


Happy sonnetting!
